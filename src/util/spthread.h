// NOTE:
// None of these are signal safe
// Also note that most of these functions are not safe to suspension,
// meaning that if the thread calling these is an spthread and is suspended
// in the middle of spthread_continue or spthread_suspend, then it may not work.

// Make sure that the calling thread cannot be suspended before calling these

// this function works similar to pthread_create, except for two differences.
// 1) the created pthread is able to be asychronously suspended, and continued
//    using the functions:
//      - spthread_suspend
//      - spthread_continue
// 2) The created pthread will be suspended before it executes the specified
//    routine. It must first be continued with `spthread_continue` before
//    it will start executing.
//
// It is worth noting that this function is not signal safe.
// In other words, it should not be called from a signal handler.
//
// to avoid repetition, see pthread_create(3) for details
// on arguments and return values as they are the same here.

// The spthread_cancel function will send a
// cancellation request to the specified thread.
//
// as of now, this function is identical to pthread_cancel(3)
// so to avoid repitition, you should look there.
//
// Here are a few things that are worth highlighting:
// - it is worth noting that it is a cancellation __request__
//   the thread may not terminate immediately, instead the
//   thread is checked whenever it calls a function that is
//   marked as a cancellation point. At those points, it will
//   start the cancellation procedure
// - to make sure all things are de-allocated properly on
//   normal exiting of the thread and when it is cancelled,
//   you should mark a defered de-allocation with
//   pthread_cleanup_push(3).
//   consider the following example:
//
//     void* thread_routine(void* arg) {
//        int* num = malloc(sizeof(int));
//        pthread_cleanup_push(&free, num);
//        return NULL;
//     }
//
//    this program will allocate an integer on the heap
//    and mark that data to be de-allocated on cleanup.
//    This means that when the thread returns from the
//    routine specified in spthread_create, free will
//    be called on num. This will also happen if the thread
//    is cancelled and not able to be exited normally.
//
//    Another function that should be used in conjunction
//    is pthread_cleanup_pop(3). I will leave that
//    to you to read more on.
//
// It is worth noting that this function is not signal safe.
// In other words, it should not be called from a signal handler.
//
// args:
// - spthread_t thread: the thread we want to cancel.
//   This thread must be created using the spthread_create() function,
//   if created by some other function, the behaviour is undefined.
//
// returns:
// - 0 on success
// - ESRCH if the thread specified is not a valid pthread

// 1. Whether or not the calling thread is an spthread (true or false)
// 2. The spthread_t of the calling thread, if it is an spthread_t

// almost always the function will be called like this:
// spthread_t self;
// bool i_am_spthread = spthread_self(&self);
